        <p>This knife is one of the first wrinkles in the case against the defendant.
            The prosecution made a big deal of how the knife the boy used to kill his father was unique and one-of-a-kind.
            Since the boy was seen buying the knife and it was found with his dead father, the boy must have killed him.
            From the defense the boy claims he lost the knife that night from a hole in his pocket.
        </p>
        <p>
            Juror #8 bought an exact replica of the knife from a similar store in the area,
            which disproved the uniqueness of the knife.

            A picture of an apartment floorplan.
            It shows a stairway at the bottom left that connnects upwards to a long halway from left to right.
            At top right end of the hallway is a door to a room marked bedroom.
            There is also a layout for an unmarked room that appears to be a bathroom.
            A hand is reaching over the top of the diagram to point at the door to the stairs."/>

        <p>This diagram is piece of evidence that weakens the case against the defendant.
            The prosecution made a big deal of how the old man heard the boy yelling "I'm gonna kill you at his father".
            Then the old man claims to have heard a body thud against the floor.
            He claims further to have run to his door and seen the boy fleeing the scene of the crime.
        </p>
        <p>
            When examining this peice of evidence in the deliberation room,
            the jurors realize that the old man walked with a limp and could not have possibly
            made it to the door on time to see the boy flee the scene of the crime.
